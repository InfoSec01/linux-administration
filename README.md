# Linux Administration: Mastering User, File, Service, Network, Backup & Logging Management

Welcome to my comprehensive Linux Administration portfolio — where professional system management meets real-world organizational impact.

## Why Linux Administration Matters

In today's enterprise environments, Linux servers power critical applications, websites, and services. Managing these systems with precision ensures security, stability, and uninterrupted service delivery — all essential for business success.

This repository showcases my hands-on expertise in managing Linux users and groups, securing filesystems, troubleshooting services, configuring network services, implementing backup strategies, and centralizing system logging and monitoring.

## What You Will Find Here

### 1. Creating and Managing Users and Groups  
Efficient user and group management is the cornerstone of secure Linux administration.  
- How to add, modify, and delete users/groups  
- Assigning roles and permissions based on organizational policies  
- Enforcing least privilege principles to minimize security risks

### 2. Managing the Linux Filesystem  
Protecting sensitive data starts with robust filesystem permissions.  
- Understanding file ownership and permission levels (rwx)  
- Implementing Access Control Lists (ACLs) for fine-grained permissions  
- Ensuring only authorized users can access or modify files/directories  

### 3. Managing and Troubleshooting Linux Services and Processes  
System services keep applications running smoothly. When issues arise, quick diagnosis and resolution are vital.  
- Understanding init systems (Systemd) and service management  
- Monitoring process health and resource usage  
- Troubleshooting common application/service failures with logs and tools  

### 4. Configuring Network Services  
Networking is the backbone of modern systems and web applications.  
- Configuring DHCP for automatic IP address assignment  
- Setting up DNS for hostname resolution  
- Deploying Apache web server for hosting services  

### 5. Backing Up and Restoring Linux Systems  
Data loss can cripple any business. Proactive backup strategies protect against downtime and data corruption.  
- Implementing file-level backups with `rsync` and `tar`  
- Creating disk image and snapshot backups for rapid recovery  
- Automating backup jobs and testing restoration processes  

### 6. Centralized Logging and Monitoring  
Logs provide a window into system health and security events. Centralized monitoring streamlines issue detection across enterprise networks.  
- Configuring local and centralized logging using `rsyslog` and `Logwatch`  
- Setting up log rotation policies to manage disk usage  
- Monitoring system logs to detect anomalies and potential threats
