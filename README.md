<h1># 🛡️ Linux Administration: Real-World Skills for Secure & Reliable Systems</h1>
</div>

Welcome to the **Linux Administration** lab — a professionally built and documented guide through core system administration tasks that ensure security, reliability, and performance in any production environment.

This project isn't just academic—it's designed to demonstrate how I apply real-world Linux knowledge to protect business assets, optimize infrastructure, and support mission-critical operations.

## 👥 User & Group Management

Creating and managing users and groups ensures fine-grained access control to system resources.

- Set up multiple users and groups for secure role-based access.
- Assigned proper permissions using `usermod`, `groupadd`, and `chmod`.

## 📂 Filesystem Permissions

Controlled access to sensitive files and directories using Linux's robust permission system.

- Used `chown`, `chmod`, and `umask` to restrict access.
- Ensured only authorized users could modify or view specific files.

## 🔧 Services & Processes

Managed and troubleshooted services to ensure high system uptime and performance.

- Monitored and restarted services using `systemctl`, `top`, and `ps`.
- Diagnosed memory and CPU usage by rogue processes.

## 🌐 Network Services

Configured critical services like DHCP, DNS, and Apache.

- Set up DHCP and DNS for automated IP and domain resolution.
- Installed and configured Apache for web services.

## 💾 Backup & Restore

Simulated a business disaster-recovery scenario.

- Used `rsync`, `tar`, and `crontab` for scheduled backups.
- Configured SSH and key-based auth for secure remote backups.
- Created disk images using `dd` and mounted them for validation.

## 📊 Centralized Logging & Monitoring

Built a logging system to detect problems before they escalate.

- Configured `rsyslog`, `logrotate`, and `Logwatch` for log collection and summarization.
- Analyzed logs to identify anomalies and system misbehavior.
